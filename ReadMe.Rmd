# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
This course project is focused on getting and tidying data.  The data source is 
1. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, create a second, independent tidy data set with the _average_ of each variable for each activity and each subject.


__Script:__ "run_analysis.R"
The purpose of this script is to retrieve the data from the UCI-HAR dataset, 

_script requirements
````
install.packages("dplyr")
````

Download the data to an existing directory named data.  If the directory does not exist it will be created.
````
if(!file.exists("/data")) {
        dir.create("data") 
}
if(!file.exists("./data/projdata.zip")) {
        data.source.url<-"https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip"
        download.file(url=data.source.url,destfile="./data/projdata.zip",method="curl")
        download.date<-date()
        
}
````

This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.
