# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
This course project is focused on collecting, work with and cleaning data, and ultimately creating a tidy data set.  The data source is based on a study of "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set".  _The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data._ 

_The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain._

## Project Objectives  
1. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.  
2. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.   
3. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set  
4. Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names.   
5. From the data set in step 4, create a second, independent tidy data set with the _average_ of each variable for each activity and each subject.  

Note that the actual process I used to does not follow the exact sequence shown above, and it does end up with the outcome that is shown in step 5.  

__Script:__ "run_analysis.R"
The purpose of this script is to retrieve the data from the UCI-HAR dataset, 

_Script requirements_
Packages that must be installed:  
````
install.packages("dplyr")

Data that must be installed:  
The UCI-HAR data set is required to process run this script.  Download the data to an existing directory named data.  If the directory does not exist it will be created.  
````
# downloadData.R
## Create the ./data directory if it does not exist.
if(!file.exists("/data")) {
        dir.create("data") 
}
## Download the data from the Internet if it does not exist.
if(!file.exists("./data/projdata.zip")) {
        data.source.url<-"https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip"
        download.file(url=data.source.url,destfile="./data/projdata.zip",method="curl")
        download.date<-date()
##Manually unzip the file so that it can be processed.
